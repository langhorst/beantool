Beantool
========

Beantool is a command line utility for monitoring and administering a Beanstalkd
pool. It is being developed in conjunction with a host of internal components,
so updates will be sporadic. Any suggestions are welcome!

The version will be upped to 1.0 when it's ready to be used in production. Until
then, use at your own risk. And even at 1.0, use at your own risk. :)

Refer to `beantool -h` and the code for documentation.
